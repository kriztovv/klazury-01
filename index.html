      <h2 class="bigHeader">What is Marathon?</h2>
      <p class="p1">
        If you aren't familiar with the franchise, the Marathon trilogy is what
        Bungie earned its reputation on before it became synonymous with Halo
        and Destiny. These early first-person shooters released for Mac OS
        between 1994 and 1996, and after a 27-year break Bungie is returning to
        the universe it created – in fact, this is the
        <strong>first</strong> completely new project from Bungie in
        <strong>over a decade!</strong> This new Marathon game is set to be a
        PvP-focused extraction shooter, where you'll need to compete with other
        players for riches, renown, and survival in an ever-evolving world.

          <h3>The Rebirth of a Classic</h3>
          <p>
            Bungie's upcoming game Marathon revives a beloved name from the
            studio's history, but with a modern twist. While it shares its
            universe with the original Marathon trilogy from the 1990s, the new
            game is not a direct sequel. Instead, it introduces an entirely
            fresh experience, blending Bungie’s storytelling legacy with
            innovative gameplay mechanics. As an extraction shooter, it diverges
            from the studio's previous works like Destiny, focusing on intense
            player-versus-player dynamics. This reinvention represents Bungie's
            leap into uncharted territory while honoring its roots.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass">
          <h3>Marathon’s Mysterious World</h3>
          <p>
            Set on the intriguing planet of Tau Ceti IV, Marathon invites
            players into a universe filled with secrets, dangers, and
            opportunities. Players step into the shoes of "Runners," cybernetic
            mercenaries vying for riches, fame, and survival. The game
            emphasizes exploration and high-stakes retrieval missions in an
            unpredictable, immersive environment. Tau Ceti IV's alien landscapes
            and its lore promise to be a focal point of the gameplay experience,
            offering rich storytelling alongside intense action.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="glass">
          <h3>Multiplayer Focus</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike Bungie’s recent titles, Marathon is a dedicated PvP-focused
            game. As an extraction shooter, it tasks players with competing
            against each other to retrieve valuable loot and complete
            objectives. Full cross-play and cross-save support ensure a seamless
            experience across platforms, fostering a dynamic and competitive
            player base. This multiplayer-centric approach marks a bold
            departure for Bungie, leaning into the growing popularity of this
            genre while ensuring that the core DNA of teamwork and strategy
            remains.

        <div class="glass">
          <h3>Anticipation Builds</h3>
          <p>
            While Marathon has no confirmed release date, fans can expect the
            game to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Bungie has
            already announced plans for comprehensive playtesting, expected to
            begin in 2025. This timeline gives the studio ample time to refine
            the gameplay experience, ensuring a polished and balanced product.
            With Bungie’s track record of delivering genre-defining experiences,
            the anticipation for Marathon continues to grow as players eagerly
            await their chance to step into this new chapter.
          </p>

        <div class="glass">
          <h3>The Role of Runners in Marathon</h3>
          <p>
            In Marathon, players embody "Runners," highly skilled cybernetic
            mercenaries who venture into the alien world of Tau Ceti IV. These
            characters are tasked with scavenging for precious artifacts, data,
            and resources, all while navigating treacherous environments and
            facing off against rival Runners. The concept of Runners adds depth
            to the game, blending player-driven competition with narrative
            elements. Each mission brings unique challenges, requiring tactical
            thinking, precise execution, and teamwork to emerge victorious.

        <div class="glass">
          <h3>From Destiny to Marathon</h3>
          <p>
            Bungie’s announcement of Marathon marks a significant evolution for
            the studio, stepping away from the shared-world FPS model
            popularized by Destiny. With a focus on competitive,
            extraction-based PvP gameplay, Bungie aims to expand its creative
            horizons while retaining the high-quality design and storytelling
            that fans have come to expect. This pivot reflects the studio’s
            ability to adapt to changing player preferences, signaling a new era
            in Bungie's storied history. Marathon is poised to become a flagship
            title, blending nostalgia with bold innovation.
